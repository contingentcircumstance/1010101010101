    <title>Project Proposal </title>

 <h1> Milo's final project proposal </h1>   
 
 
 <h4> What kind of website do you want to make for your final project? (Describe the finished project in detail)</h4>
 <p> I imagine my portfolio website as being somewhat simple & minimal but in a color scheme/way that does not distract from the images of my work. I will organize it kind of classically like "about, cv, contact, work" etc. The sections of my work will be split up by either years or via medium type-which might make more sense. Part of me wants to be a bit pickier about how many works I put on there/ find ways to either rotate which images are on the homepage, or make a way to randomize/have the images be interactable on the home page. </p>

 <h4>Why do you want to make this project? (for example, you want a portfolio website for applying to things, or…you want to use this project as an opportunity to learn a new skill, or…you want a new work in your portfolio that shows off you skills as a web developer/designer/artist).</h4>
 <p> I want to make a portfolio website as I am graduating this year & will need it to apply for things fairly soon. I have "attempted" to make a portfolio website before on Wordpress before learning to code and was frustrated by the idea that I had to edit a pre made layout/couldn''t customize it fully and now I can in html
</p>
 
 
 <h4> What challenges (technical, conceptual, design, etc.) do you anticipate encountering in this project? To put that another way, what do you think you’ll struggle with the most with this project? </h4>

 <p> I think some challenges I will struggle with will be relating to what layout/aesthetic choices I can make via the website that will allow it to be interesting without distracting from the work. I want to let the website be its own creative medium but I also don't want it to be unnavigable or overly complicated, as I have found other artist websites to be over the years- even artists who are well known/have been professionals for a long time. 
</p>
<p>    I do happen to personally like websites that contain a certain level of "geocities" energy to them, even if they are not from that era; and personally enjoy websites that are mazelike and difficult to operate, but I also don't want to lean into anything of that nature too hard & end up with something that can't be looked at through a professional light. </p>
<p>
    I want to take the elements that I do personally like out of the more simple earlier internet websites & find a way to still make the website seem professional and not shoddily made. 
   
   Also, if my work changes over time and lends itself to a different visual appearance, I want to be able to change the visual appearance without too much difficulty/without having to start from scratch. So, as much as I want to challenge myself for the sake of the assignment, I also am going to mostly try to make the least confusing, most long lasting format for my own benefit.
    
</p> 
<p>
     Maybe if my website is too simple, or if it feels like for the sake of class assignments, that I should add more elements to it, I can make more than one website that is experimenting w different levels of complexities added to it; or just make a non portfolio one additionally that shows that type of experimentation. 
</p>
<h4> additionally: </h4>
<p> (--Potential related idea for my portfolio site that I may or may not add in-- or may make as a separate site. Depends on feasability, will talk to Doug during our meeting/in class about.) A lot of my writing work is made via Cmap tools, where the words can be plotted and then moved around to rearrange the order they appear in. I think it would be really cool to find a way, maybe using p5js or something, to have some of the works be interactable to a certain extent; without having too much editable freedom/without the words being deletable + a reset button to put them back in their original forms. </p>
