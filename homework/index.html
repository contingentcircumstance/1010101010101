    <p> due next week (next wednesday) </p>
    <p> Your personal bio/artist statement. (This shouldn't be your polished exhibition-ready artist statement/bio. Rather, write something short and "fun." How would you write about yourself and the work from the perspective of someone in the year 1999 making their first website?)</p>
    <p> 
        A picture that represents you. Along with your bio, include a picture that represents you, in whatever way that makes sense to you. It can be a picture of you (a photograph, a drawing, etc.) or it can be a picture of an avatar or entity that you feel aligned with. </p>
        <p>
            4 or more pictures or videos of a work in your portfolio. We'll be spending more time talking about documentation later in the semester, but for now, use this as an opportunity to start gathering documentation of one of your works. (Remember, consider how you would put this on the web in the context of the 1999 version of you)</p>
            <p>
                Information about the work. Include a title, year, material/medium, and a brief description of the work</p>
                <p>An audio file.</p>
                    <p>Personality. Add some other stuff! Add background images, gifs, colors, different typefaces. Embrace the amateurish design trends of the early web. Go for maximalism! Even if you don't personally care for the GeoCities aesthetic, I ask that you indulge in it for this assignment. </p>
